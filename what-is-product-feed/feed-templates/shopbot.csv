For best results, increase the red dot setting until the scope gives you an aiming reference that is perceptible but not glaring. A certain amount of resistance is designed into the control knob to ensure that the sight is not inadvertently turned on.. This sight can be easily used with both eyes open thanks to unlimited eye relief, increasing your awareness of the surrounding environment and providing faster target acquisition. There’s no need for centring, due to the parallax free design in which the dot follows the movement of your eye whilst remaining fixed on your target.. With your Trophy red dot sight you’ll find quality amber bright high contrast lens coatings to help you distinguish between colours and allowing you to pick up the brown coat of you deer from the background. Multicoated optics give you increased brightness, clarity and colour contrast that works even in low light conditions.. This Bushnell Trophy TRS 1x25 Red Dot Scope is dry nitrogen filled and completely waterproof and fogproof. It has been tested against recoil, making is shockproof too.. A black matte finish to this scope means that it won't reflect light on your tactical ops so that you can stay out of sight of your target.. The TRS-25 sight mounts easily on any Weaver style or Picatinny rail. An Allen style cross screw is used to secure the sight to the rail, and the clamping system provides adequate strength to keep it securely mounted. Once resistance is felt when tightening the screw it should be rotated no more than ¼ additional turn as over-tightening the screw may strip the threads.. If you’re looking for a red dot scope that delivers full size performance in a sight with reduced size and low power consumption, then look no further than the TRS-25 scope from Bushnell..

Unsurpassed mechanically, using only the highest quality components that withstand a lifetime of recoil and adjustments. You can count on every click being as precise and positive years from now as on the day your ATACR was new.. As the acronym “ATACR” reveals, these superb riflescopes were originally designed for professional military, law enforcement, and other tactical applications. But never fear, you don’t have to be a professional shooter to get the best from your awesome ATACR scope.. Designed to maximise the potential of precision semi-automatic rifles, your ATACR scope is built with every conceivable feature that will speed up target engagement time.. At the heart of your ATACR riflescope are the very best extra-low dispersion (ED) lenses. They produce the most brilliant images, colour contrast, and resolving power physically possible within the bounds of optical engineering, as well as the highest light transmission levels of any riflescopes Nightforce have ever made.. Low-profile ZeroHold technology gives you an instant return to your zero point, no matter how many elevation adjustments you’ve made in the field and also lets you dial below zero. You can use the windage adjustment exposed for quick response, or capped to prevent accidental movement in the field.. The side focus parallax adjustment is marked with approximate numbered distances. The eyepiece features enhanced engraving, an integrated Power Throw Lever (PTL) and an XtremeSpeed thread for making a fast diopter adjustment.. Your 4-16x42 riflescope is available with in .1 Mrad (12 Mils per revolution) or .25 MOA (30 MOA per revolution) increments and a range of intelligent, Nightforce F1, first focal plane, illuminated reticles that provide for fast hold-off adjustments and precise ranging calculations.. DigIllum digital reticle illumination technology increases convenience and functionality in a single button control. Choose the appropriate illumination setting for your lighting conditions—either red or green, in multiple intensities from very dim to extremely bright. You can then turn off illumination to save your battery. When you turn it back on, it defaults to your previously chosen setting, ensuring your night vision will not be adversely affected and that you’re instantly ready for a shot.. The H59 reticle is a "field-tuned" version of the Nightforce H58 reticle. A widened horizontal grid by one mil for increased wind holdover. And the centre cross has been turned into a "broken cross" so groupings are less obscured and more easily seen.. The TReMoR3 reticle is all about faster shooting. The Accuracy 1st - Speed Shooting Formula is built right into the elevation hold of the reticle making even faster shooting possible.  It's field-proven to make wind calls easier. The reticle also allows one to accurately mil targets very quickly.. The Mil-R reticle allows precise ranging and accurate hold offs for effective first-shot placement and quick follow-up shots.  This reticle features a floating centre crosshair which is 1.0 Mil across, whole, half, .2 and .1 Mil-Radian graduations across the reticle, and a total of 15 Mil-Radian below centre. (high magnification image shown). Designed to meet the needs of today’s Precision Rifle Series competitor, the MIL-C reticle allows for fast and accurate shots on target. The MIL-C has a simple centre dot for a fine aiming point, while the main lines feature .2 Mil-Radian holds. Each whole Mil-Radian is numbered for fast reference under even stressful conditions..

You can count on every click being as precise and positive years from now as on the day your ATACR was new.. As the acronym “ATACR” reveals, these superb riflescopes were originally designed for professional military, law enforcement, and other tactical applications. But never fear, you don’t have to be a professional shooter to get the best from your awesome ATACR scope.. Designed to maximise the potential of precision semi-automatic rifles, your ATACR scope is built with every conceivable feature that will speed up target engagement time.. At the heart of your ATACR riflescope are the very best extra-low dispersion (ED) lenses. They produce the most brilliant images, colour contrast, and resolving power physically possible within the bounds of optical engineering, as well as the highest light transmission levels of any riflescopes Nightforce have ever made.. Low-profile ZeroStop technology gives you an easy return to your zero point, no matter how many elevation adjustments you’ve made in the field.. This patented Nightforce technology is a brilliant solution to an old problem: returning to your zero setting after extensive elevation adjustments.. After sighting in your rifle, simply set the ZeroStop according to instructions, and create a positive mechanical stopping point at your chosen zero point. No matter how many elevation adjustments you make, turning the elevation knob down to the ZeroStop setting returns you to your original zero, completely by feel—even in total darkness or while wearing gloves. No counting clicks, no need for visual reference, no wasted effort. Just an instant return to zero. Every time.. You can use the windage adjustment exposed for quick response, or capped to prevent accidental movement in the field. The side focus parallax adjustment is marked with approximate numbered distances. The eyepiece features enhanced engraving, an integrated Power Throw Lever (PTL) and an XtremeSpeed thread for making a fast diopter adjustment.. Your 5-25x56 riflescope is available with .1 Mrad (12 Mils per revolution) or .25 MOA (30 MOA per revolution) increments and a range of intelligent, Nightforce F1, first focal plane, illuminated reticles that provide for fast hold-off adjustments and precise ranging calculations.. DigIllum digital reticle illumination technology increases convenience and functionality in a single button control. Choose the appropriate illumination setting for your lighting conditions—either red or green, in multiple intensities from very dim to extremely bright. You can then turn off illumination to save your battery. When you turn it back on, it defaults to your previously chosen setting, ensuring your night vision will not be adversely affected and that you’re instantly ready for a shot.. The H59 reticle is a "field-tuned" version of the Nightforce H58 reticle. A widened horizontal grid by one mil for increased wind holdover. And the centre cross has been turned into a "broken cross" so groupings are less obscured and more easily seen.. The TReMoR3 reticle is all about faster shooting. The Accuracy 1st - Speed Shooting Formula is built right into the elevation hold of the reticle making even faster shooting possible.  It's field-proven to make wind calls easier. The reticle also allows one to accurately mil targets very quickly.. The Mil-R reticle allows precise ranging and accurate hold offs for effective first-shot placement and quick follow-up shots.  This reticle features a floating centre crosshair which is 1.0 Mil across, whole, half, .2 and .1 Mil-Radian graduations across the reticle, and a total of 15 Mil-Radian below centre. (high magnification image shown). Designed to meet the needs of today’s Precision Rifle Series competitor, the MIL-C reticle allows for fast and accurate shots on target. The MIL-C has a simple centre dot for a fine aiming point, while the main lines feature .2 Mil-Radian holds. Each whole Mil-Radian is numbered for fast reference under even stressful conditions.. The MIL-XT™ has a simple centre dot for a fine aiming point at centre, while the main lines feature .2 Mil-Radian holds. Each whole Mil-Radian is numbered for fast reference under even stressful conditions. Below centre, whole Mil-Radian intersections feature a floating dot. Dots are placed at .2 Mil-Radian increments, while whole Mil-Radians are increased in size for fast counting. Additional marks are placed at half Mil-Radian increments as well. Numbers below centre alternate in size for easy counting and verification of appropriate hold points.. The MOAR F1 reticle features 1 MOA elevation and windage markings for accurate range finding and hold-offs. A floating centre crosshair and bold 3, 6 and 9 o'clock posts make this reticle fast and easy to use in the field. This MOAR F1 reticle features a 30 MOA scale below centre..

NXS riflescopes have performed impeccably in the nastiest, most hostile environments on earth. They have been blown up, run over, even shot through, and completed their missions time and time again.. In more peaceful pursuits, they have been instrumental in winning countless long-range competitions and setting new world records in the process.. Serious hunters—who must have optics that endure repeated recoil, blistering heat, sub- zero cold, rain, sleet, snow, mountains, rocks, falls, horses and even baggage handlers— have come to prize NXS riflescopes for the same reasons.. Based on Nightforce’s ultra popular 32mm scope, the 42mm NXS has a larger objective lens making it even more effective in low light. In addition, it’s packed with even more technology, additional features, and more options, making it an ideal choice for many activities including a mountain or safari rifle, or the ideal complement to your favourite AR-15/AR-10..

When you turn it back on, it defaults to your previously chosen setting, ensuring your night vision will not be adversely affected and that you’re instantly ready for a shot.. In the Mil-R reticle, .5 Mil and .10 Mil divisions allow for multiple zeroes, holdover, hold-under and windage adjustments without touching elevation or windage knobs making it excellent for range estimation.. If you’re looking for a riflescope that has streamlined proportions, minimal weight, offers performance far beyond its size, and is built to standards that exceed virtually any other riflescope on the market then look no further than the 42mm NXS from Nightforce..

A full 110 MOA of internal adjustment make the 3.5-15x50 extremely versatile in the field and applicable to a wide range of applications.. NXS riflescopes have performed impeccably in the nastiest, most hostile environments  on earth. They have been blown up, run over, even shot through, and completed their missions time and time again. In more peaceful pursuits, they have been instrumental in winning countless long-range competitions and setting new world records in the process.. Serious hunters—who must have optics that endure repeated recoil, blistering heat, sub-zero cold, rain, sleet, snow, mountains, rocks, falls, horses and even baggage handlers— have come to prize NXS riflescopes for the same reasons.. The 50mm objective maximises light transmission and an easy to reach side focus allows you to adjust parallax.. Your NXS comes with an illuminated MOAR reticle. DigIllum digital reticle illumination technology increases convenience and functionality in a single button control. Choose the appropriate illumination setting for your lighting conditions—either red or green, in multiple intensities from very dim to extremely bright. You can then turn off illumination to save your battery. When you turn it back on, it defaults to your previously chosen setting, ensuring your night vision will not be adversely affected and that you’re instantly ready for a shot.. Nightforce's ZeroStop technology allows you to return to your zero setting after extensive elevation adjustments. After sighting in your rifle, simply set the ZeroStop and create a positive mechanical stopping point at your chosen zero point. No matter how many elevation adjustments you make, turning the elevation knob down to the ZeroStop setting returns you to your original zero, completely by feel—even in total darkness or while wearing gloves. No counting clicks, no need for visual reference, no wasted effort.. If you’re looking for a riflescope that has streamlined proportions, minimal weight, offers performance far beyond its size, and is built to standards that exceed virtually any other riflescope on the market then look no further than the 50mm NXS from Nightforce..

Originally developed for the U.S. military’s extreme long range shooting and hard target interdiction, your 5.5-22x56 from Nightforce has a large, 56mm objective lens that provides maximum clarity and resolution across the entire magnification range.. The broad magnification range expands the world of extended range shooting for the accomplished marksman, meaning that targets at almost any distance are within range. The 5.5 power remains highly effective for shots at close ranges.. NXS riflescopes have performed impeccably in the nastiest, most hostile environments on earth. They have been blown up, run over, even shot through, and completed their missions time and time again.. In more peaceful pursuits, they have been instrumental in winning countless long-range competitions and setting new world records in the process..

Your long range 56mm NXS is available in a selection of second focal plane illuminated reticles with either MOA or Mil adjustments to suit your preference.. The Mil-Dot reticle has see-through dots and posts that do not obscure your target, allowing for more precise estimation of range.. In the Mil-R reticle, .5 Mil and .10 Mil divisions allow for multiple zeroes, holdover, hold-under and windage adjustments without touching elevation or windage knobs making it excellent for range estimation.. The MOAR reticle provides 1 MOA elevation and windage markings, meaning that more accurate range finding and hold-offs are possible on smaller targets at longer ranges. Combined with a floating centre crosshair, this makes for a reticle extremely fast and easy to use in the field.. After requests from customers for a finer version of the MOAR reticle for even more precision at extreme ranges, Nightforce developed the MOAR-T reticle. .0625 MOA lines, with 1 MOA elevation and windage markings, an illuminated centre dot allow for accurate range finding and holdover estimation at the longest distances..

You can count on every click being as precise and positive years from now as on the day your ATACR was new.. As the acronym “ATACR” reveals, these superb riflescopes were originally designed for professional military, law enforcement, and other tactical applications. But never fear, you don’t have to be a professional shooter to get the best from your awesome ATACR scope.. Designed to maximise the potential of precision semi-automatic rifles, your ATACR scope is built with every conceivable feature that will speed up target engagement time..

Low-profile ZeroStop technology gives you an easy return to your zero point, no matter how many elevation adjustments you’ve made in the field. This patented Nightforce technology is a brilliant solution to an old problem: returning to your zero setting after extensive elevation adjustments.. After sighting in your rifle, simply set the ZeroStop according to instructions, and create a positive mechanical stopping point at your chosen zero point.

You can then turn off illumination to save your battery. When you turn it back on, it defaults to your previously chosen setting, ensuring your night vision will not be adversely affected and that you’re instantly ready for a shot.. The Mil-R reticle allows precise ranging and accurate hold offs for effective first-shot placement and quick follow-up shots.  This reticle features a floating centre crosshair which is 1.0 Mil across, whole, half, .2 and .1 Mil-Radian graduations across the reticle, and a total of 15 Mil-Radian below centre.

The MOAR reticle features 1 MOA elevation and windage markings for accurate range finding and hold-offs. A floating centre crosshair and bold 3, 6 and 9 o'clock posts make this reticle fast and easy to use in the field. This MOAR F1 reticle features a 30 MOA scale below centre.. Introduced after requests from customers for a finer version of the MOAR reticle for even more precision at extreme ranges, Nightforce developed the MOAR-T reticle. .0625 MOA lines, with 1 MOA elevation and windage markings, an illuminated centre dot allow for accurate range finding and holdover estimation at the longest distances..

Easily switch the tripod from vertical to horizontal position thanks to the 90° centre column mechanism, which is housed in the upper casting for compactness and can be quickly extended as required. Benefit from more shooting freedom for your photography and videography. In fact, you can switch orientation even with your camera attached so you can save time and keep your equipment in the desired position.. The legs can be extended and adjust quickly, thanks to the Quick Power Lock levers, which block and unblock each leg section. The QPL levers are specially designed to provide a more comfortable single-handed opening of all leg sections in one single movement for your convenience. The QPL’s levers also offer more powerful locking of every leg section, ensuring your tripod is as rigid as possible.. Intuitive and ergonomic leg angle selectors allow each leg to be solidly and independently set to any of the preset angles, which also gives you more freedom to shoot according to your individual style. A bubble level is built into the top of the centre column for precise framing. This is freely rotating, which means it can be positioned wherever it is easiest for you to observe while you adjust your tripod. That means it won't be obscured by any of your equipment, or prevent you from seeing your camera controls.. The top casting of the 055XPRO3 has a handy Easy Link connector that is compatible with an accessory (such as an LED light, flash, reflector, or other piece of equipment) on an extending arm or bracket. Make your tripod a practical mobile studio.. The included ball head lets you fine tune your adjustments thanks to separate knobs for both the ball and the 360° panning, as well as a friction control knob for more exacting placement. The 200PL quick-release clamp and plate allow for quick camera attachment and removal, and two bubble levels let you adjust your camera so the horizon is level.

Ideal for use with cameras, binoculars and spotting scopes, the Manfrotto 190 is an ideal companion for photographers and videographers with a wide range of shooting styles. Its compact size means it's easy to carry around when you're on the go. When you're ready to frame and shoot or observe, simply extend the horizontal column mechanism in just seconds.. The column is housed in the tripod's top casting to save space, and can be switched to vertical orientation so you never miss out on your next important shoot. This also means you can keep your camera attached when switching orientation, so you won't have to worry about disassembling your equipment. The 190XPRO tripod's legs are quickly extendible and adjustable, and each leg section can be effectively blocked or unblocked with the efficient and powerful Quick Power Lock (QPL) levers.. Open the leg sections single-handedly with the QPL levels, which will keep your tripod extremely stable and rigid compared with traditional lever designs. Each leg can be customised to a pre-set angle independently, giving you tremendous shooting freedom. With the freely rotating bubble level, you can frame even more precisely and position your equipment so that nothing obscures your view.. In the top casting of the 190XPRO you will also find an Easy Link connector, which can support a video or photo accessory such as a reflector or flash. These can be quickly fitted to an extending arm, turning your tripod into a practical mobile studio.. Another benefit of the 190XRPO is the durable magnesium XPro ball head, which has a quick-release camera plate so you can use it with an extensive selection of devices from cameras to sports optics. It includes a triple locking system for guaranteed stability, and has friction control to ensure the weight of your equipment is evenly distributed. In addition, new polymer rings provide smooth, accurate camera movement and none of the unpleasant grease of older products..

Equipped with a 4x zoom and Zeiss’s T* multi-layer coating, your 4-16x scope offers 90 percent light transmission for optimum image brightness and clear target resolution. Zeiss’s LotuTec® lens coating enables a clear and unhindered view in all weather conditions. Waterproof and shockproof, you can rely on your V4 Conquest in any condition.. Built with an illuminated second focal plane #60 reticle, your Conquest scope works perfectly whether you’re in glaring sunlight or at dusk. This awesome illuminated reticle is perfect for hunters who prefer a more traditional reticle. The scaled back minimalist design features a fine, dimmable illuminated dot, and is intuitive to use. The Reticle 60 is lighter and finer in looks than the similar Reticle 40. The posts only cover half­ the area, leaving double the amount of space between them. This makes it perfect for precision shooting with minimum coverage of the target game. At 12 x magnification and a target coverage of just 0.55cm at 100m you keep a good overview without losing sight of the finer details. The illuminated dot is very bright, and can therefore be used for daytime hunting. The dot can be finely adjusted, which makes it ideal for night-time hunting too.. The new 2020 range of 4-16x44 Conquest scopes provides turret configurations to suit the needs of hunters and shooters with different requirements. For hunters who want to ensure that turrets can’t accidentally be changed and are protected at all times, the riflescope is available with capped turrets. For those who want the ability to make rapid adjustments for elevation then there’s an option with a capped windage and exposed elevation turret.. For models with a quickly adjustable and external locking elevation turret, adjustments are tactile and offer perfectly audible clicks to provide additional reassurance and indicate any change in elevation and windage. Regardless of whether your shooting distance changes rapidly this fantastic turret will allow you to react quickly and meet fast-changing challenges with a few swift clicks. All models with external elevation turrets incorporate Zeiss’s highly coveted Ballistic Stop, for an absolute and precise return to zero setting..

Ideal for beginners, this awesome 70mm refractor telescope is equipped with technology that uses your smartphone to analyse the night sky and calculate its position in real-time.. With your StarSense Explore telescope, locating objects in the night sky has never been easier, faster, or more accurate.. Within minutes of setting up the telescope, you'll be navigating the sky with confidence. Simply place your phone in the unique StarSense dock and launch the StarSense Explorer app. After aligning your phone to the telescope's optics (a quick, 2-minute procedure), the StarSense Explorer app on your phone generates a list of celestial objects currently visible. Make your selection and arrows appear on-screen, guiding you as you to move the telescope. When the object is ready to view, the bullseye turns green.. The app is ideal for beginners thanks to its user-friendly interface and detailed tutorials. It's like having your own personal tour guide of the night sky.. The StarSense Explorer app uses patent-pending technology and your smartphone to determine exactly where the telescope is pointed in the night sky. A Lost in Space Algorithm (LISA), like the ones satellites use in orbit to correctly reorient themselves, helps the app match star patterns it detects overhead to its internal database.. StarSense Explorer works with most modern smartphones, including iPhone 6 and up and most devices running Android 7.1.2 or later manufactured since 2016.. Even if you live in a light polluted city location, StarSense Explorer is advanced enough to be able to pick out Jupiter, Saturn, Venus, the Orion Nebula, double stars, and a few more of the most famous celestial objects.. But if you can take the telescope to an even slightly darker location, more objects will become visible..

Ideal for detecting, observing and identifying game in the darkness this fantastic night vision scope from Zeiss is built with innovative technology that provides you a considerable advantage at night in forests and fields. Heat sources can be reliably identified even over long distances and extensive areas and game can be clearly identified in the dark and thereby maximising your hunting success.. The monocular-style camera has a range of 1350 yards, with 2.5x optical magnification, and 4x digital zoom in 0.5x steps, for precise target identification. The imagery is displayed on a 1280 x 960 LCOS display with your choice of four colour palettes: black hot, white hot, red hot, and rainbow.. Zeiss have built your DTI thermal imaging monocular with the very best quality optics, materials and manufacturing.. The excellent optics in your DTI 3/35 deliver detailed and high-contrast images and outstanding optical performance thanks to the perfect interaction of sensor, electronics, display and eyepiece. The high-resolution HD-LCOS display delivers detailed images for reliable spotting. The wide field of view of 19m at 100m allows you to observe a much larger area providing you with the significant advantage in the forests and fields at night.. Some thermal imaging cameras are only optimised for use with the right hand. Operation with the left hand is therefore very uncomfortable. In addition, the shape of the device often forces you to adjust your grip so that the fingertips rest on the buttons. After hours of stalking through the cold, the hand can quickly get tired and the fingers can become numb. Feeling the buttons can be difficult.. The optimised shape of the ZEISS DTI 3/35 puts as little strain on the hunter's hands as possible. Whether left-handed or right-handed, the ZEISS DTI 3/35 can be operated from either side. The triangular button layout in combination with the specific form factor of the keys of the ZEISS DTI 3/35 ensures a natural hand position, with the fingertips resting relaxed on the controls. Thanks to the intelligent positioning of the buttons, each function can be controlled intuitively. This gives you a peace of mind, eliminates unnecessary distractions, and increases the success of the hunt.. Identifying game in the darkness is much more difficult than during the day. A single wild boar is not necessarily a male. It could be a mother sow with her youngsters hiding in the tall grass or in the thicket. The ability to make the right decision in this situation makes all the difference. The Zeiss DTI 3/35 thermal imaging camera provides the perfect combination of magnification and detail recognition. By utilising the 0.5 zoom increments, you can quickly switch between the individual magnification levels.. Your Zeiss DTI 3/35 thermal imaging camera can be connected to the Zeiss Hunting App via wireless LAN connection. This makes it easier than ever to share or manage your hunting photos and videos..
